%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  THIS IS WHERE THE RANDOMIZER MAGIC HAPPENS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The #raXX are keys which will later be replaced by the Python code with randomized values.
% Warning: in its current form, the latex file does not compile, because of the # keys in math mode!

\item Let us consider 2-dimensional convolution with spatial size $ (#ra01 \times #ra02) $. We are using a kernel with size $ (#ra03 \times #ra04) $, a stride $ #ra05 $ and a zero-padding of size $ #ra06 $.

\smallskip
What will be the spatial size of the feature map, which is the output of the convolution?

\smallskip
Note that spatial size does not depend on the number of input or output channels. \textbf{Show your calculation.}

\smallskip
\begin{solution}
Solution: Output size will be $ (#ra07, #ra08) $.
\end{solution}
